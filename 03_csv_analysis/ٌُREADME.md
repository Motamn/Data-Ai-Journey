# Day 3 - CSV analysis using Pandas

today I made basic analysis with pandas for the first time,
I learned about CSV, feather, Parquet and excel data formats that are used in data analysis.
I'm currently on this [Pandas course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uvysYbKdjM) to build a foundation in this important tool of analysis.
